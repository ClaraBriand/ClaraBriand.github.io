I am currently a Master's student at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS). 

Between February and May 2026 I will be an intern student at the Max Planck Institute of Leipzig, under the supervision of [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/) and [Viktoriia Borovik](https://sites.google.com/view/viktoriia-borovik/).

I am interested in combinatorics, dynamical systems, and classical algebraic geometry.

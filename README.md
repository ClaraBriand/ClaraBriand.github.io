# About me

I am currently a Master's student at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS). 

Between February and May 2026 I will be an intern student at the Max Planck Institute of Leipzig, under the supervision of Bernd Sturmfels and Viktoriia Borovik.

I am interested in combinatorics, dynamical systems, and classical algebraic geometry.
